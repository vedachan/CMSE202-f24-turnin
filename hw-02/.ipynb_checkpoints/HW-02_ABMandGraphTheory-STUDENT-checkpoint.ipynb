    "\n",
    "Swarming is a natural phenomenon exhibitied by many species such as fish, bees, and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-large-flock-of-birds-flying-over-a-field-b7MZ6iGIoSI\" alt=\"Image of a swarm of birds\"> birds</a>. Studying this phenomenon not only enhances our standing of biological systems, but it has also inspired <a href=\"https://fiveable.me/lists/key-swarm-intelligence-algorithms\">new intelligent designs and control strategies for engineered systems </a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part you will study an ABM model for swarming of birds implemented using OOP. The model we use is the two dimensional <a href=\"https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/swarm10.pdf\">D'Orsogna model</a>, which studies the interactions of $N$ agents whose motion is characterized by their positions $x_i$ and velocities $v_i$ in time, where $i=1,2,\\ldots, N$. The initial state of the flock, i.e., the initial positions and velocities, are chosen indepentently at random from a uniform distribution over $[-1,1]$. Note that the initial distribution does not influence the behavior of the flock after some time has passed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of each bird is influenced by local and a global force terms. The local terms are due to self-propelling motion of the bird and drag. The global force captures the pariwise attractive-repulsive social interactions among the birds in the flock. A bird's ability to respond to the presence of another bird decays over space to mimic the decay in sensory signals due to the fading of smell, sight, or sound over longer distances. The attraction term is related to the bird's desire to stay close to its fellow birds. The flock state updates according to a differential equation, but that part of the assignment will be provided in the class `MoveBird`. "

For example, you can initialize a list of birds with different masses (maybe the masses are distributed around the average mass that you researched). You can also explore altering the sensory perception of birds (so for example, assume they only respond to other birds in the flock within their eye of sight), etc. Feel free to play around, and let us konw if you get some cool results to share!"
