The dataset includes properties like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and other measurements important for understanding wine characteristics. This data was collected to support predictive models of wine quality, based on a range of measurable attributes. The wine dataset is distributed into two files: 1) for red wines and 2) for white wines. \n",

    "\n",
    "In exploring the characteristics of wine, understanding the relationship between individual chemical components can provide insights into the wine’s flavor profile, quality, and potential fermentation properties. One simple yet valuable analysis is examining the relationship between citric acid and fixed acidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Citric acid, a natural preservative that adds freshness, often contributes to the tartness and overall acidity in wine. Meanwhile, fixed acidity is a broader measure that includes acids, such as tartaric and malic acid, giving wine its sharp, crisp taste. By performing a single-variable linear regression with citric acid as the predictor for fixed acidity, we can investigate whether higher levels of citric acid are associated with an increase in fixed acidity, potentially indicating a specific acid balance characteristic to certain wine types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This regression analysis can reveal subtle patterns in acidity management, helping winemakers predict and control acidity levels for quality consistency, and giving scientists insight into how specific acid types interact in the broader context of wine chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "&#9989;  **Question 3.1 (3 points)**: Using the OLS method in `statsmodels`, perform a linear regression to predict the fixed acidity of a wine sample using its citric acid content and display the results summary. Remember that you may need to use the add_constant() method to ensure OLS fits a general line  y = ax + b  to the data rather than a line through the origin  y = ax .\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, make sure that you’re using the entire wine dataset, not just a subset of the data. So the first part should be to make a combined dataframe (using `pd.concat`) out of white and red"
